            <h3>League of Legends</h3> 
            <p> 
                (abbreviated LoL or League) is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for
                Microsoft Windows and macOS. Originally inspired by Defense of the Ancients, the game has followed a freemium model since its release on October 27,
                2009. League of Legends is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene. The 2019 League of Legends World Championship
                had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million, with a minimum prize pool of US$2.5 million.

            <p>
                As in other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, each player in League of Legends controls a character ("champion")
                with a set of unique abilities. Most games involve two teams of five players, with each player using a different champion.
                The two teams compete to be the first to destroy the Nexus structure within the opposing base.
                Over the course of each game, champions become stronger and gain additional abilities by earning experience and thereby levelling up.
                Experience is earned by killing enemies (or being nearby when a teammate does). Champions also build strength over the course of the game 
                by buying progressively more powerful items using gold, which is earned by killing non-player enemies, killing or assisting in killing enemy
                players, destroying enemy structures, or selling other items.
